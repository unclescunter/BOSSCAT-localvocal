# LocalVocal - Bosscat flavour - Speech AI assistant OBS Plugin


## Introduction

LocalVocal - Bosscat flavour is a shameless copy of the original [LocalVocal](https://github.com/royshil/obs-localvocal) which lets you transcribe, locally on your machine, speech into text and (hopefully) simultaneously translate to any language. ✅ No GPU required, ✅ no cloud costs, ✅ no network and ✅ no downtime! Privacy first - all data stays on your machine.

The plugin had a few limitations on linux and I hada claude subscription, this is all vibe coded "upgrades" so download and run at your own risk. ONLY tested on [Nobara](https://nobaraproject.org/) Linux which is a version of Fedora.
It should build for you but YMMV.

The plugin runs [OpenAI's Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) to process real-time speech and predict a transcription, utilizing [Whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) from [ggerganov](https://github.com/ggerganov) to run the model efficiently on CPUs and GPUs. Translation is done with [CTranslate2](https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2).

## Features I talked claude into adding
- A live view dock that prints all text in a scene into obs for the creator
- A "mute subtitles" button on that dock tht hides all subtitles. -> I'm looking at making this link to the source's visibility.
- Subtitle decay in seconds, line length and line limit all work on linux now, freetype2 just isn't capable of textwrapping itself
- The ability to label separate inputs so avoid confusion if titles are the same colour
- ***untested*** the ability to use a separate whisper server on a self defined networked device
- actually builds for fedora now, shopuld build for others. there were a couple of quirks like having to ```export CFLAGS="-fPIC"
export CXXFLAGS="-fPIC"``` or add ```-DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON``` 
This should Todd Howard now just follow the build instructions.

## Features that have changed
- Muting audio sources no longer turns subtitles off, for that use audio source visibility. That should turn it off cleanly

## Features I think I broke/will fix
- Local translation with whisper, everything else works maybe this is just how I'm setting it up.

### Available Versions

LocalVocal -Bosscat Flavour is available on Linux in a "build-it-yourself" capacity. I will enver build for windows but anyone is free to do that if they want to. Sorry mac users I'm not sailing the money boat.

- **Linux x86_64**: This version is for Linux systems with x86_64 architecture.
  - **generic**: This version runs on all systems. See [Generic variants](#generic-variants) for more details
  - **NVidia**: This version is optimized for systems with NVIDIA GPUs. See [NVidia optimized variants](#nvidia-optimized-variants) for more details
  - **AMD**: This version is optimized for systems with AMD GPUs. See [AMD optimized variants](#amd-optimized-variants) for more details

Make sure to download the version that matches your system's hardware and operating system for the best performance.

Whisper backends are now loaded dynamically when the plugin starts, which has 2 major benefits:

* **Better CPU performance and compatibility** - Whisper can automatically select the best CPU backend that works on your system out of all the ones available. This means that the plugin can now make full use of newer CPUs with more features, as well as making it usable on even older hardware than before (prior to v0.5.0 it was assumed that users would have at least AVX2 capable CPUs)
* **More stability** - If a backend is present that cannot be used on your system, either due to unavailable CPU features, missing dependencies, or something else, it will simply not be loaded instead of causing a crash <- (UncleScunter: I hope)

To ensure the plugin works "out-of-the-box", it is configured by default to use the CPU only (this is also the case for users upgrading from versions older than v0.5.0). This is to avoid immediate crashes on startup if for any reason your GPU cannot be used by one of the Whisper backends (e.g. the Metal backend on Apple just crashes if it is unable to allocate a buffer to load a model into)

If you want to use GPU acceleration, please ensure you go into the plugin settings and select your desired GPU acceleration backend

#### Generic variants

These variants should run well on any system regardless of hardware configuration. They contain the following Whispercpp backends:

* CPU
  * Generic x86_64
  * Generic x86_64 with SSE4.2
  * Sandy Bridge (CPU with SSE4.2, AVX)
  * Haswell (CPU with SSE4.2, AVX, F16C, AVX2, BMI2, FMA)
  * Sky Lake (CPU with SSE4.2, AVX, F16C, AVX2, BMI2, FMA, AVX512)
  * Ice Lake (CPU with SSE4.2, AVX, F16C, AVX2, BMI2, FMA, AVX512, AVX512_VBMI AVX512_VNNI)
  * Alder Lake (CPU with SSE4.2, AVX, F16C, AVX2, BMI2, FMA, AVX_VNNI)
  * Sapphire Rapids (CPU with SSE4.2, AVX, F16C, AVX2, BMI2, FMA, AVX512, AVX512_VBMI AVX512_VNNI, AVX512_BF16, AMX_TITLE, AMX_INT8)
* OpenBLAS - Used in conjunction with a CPU backend to accelerate processing speed
* Vulkan - Standard cross-platform graphics library allowing for GPU accelerated processing on GPUs that aren't supported by CUDA or ROCm. Can also work with integrated GPUs)
  * May need the Vulkan runtime on Windows which can be downloaded at https://sdk.lunarg.com/sdk/download/1.4.328.1/windows/VulkanRT-X64-1.4.328.1-Installer.exe
* OpenCL (currently Linux only) - Industry standard parallel compute library that may be faster than Vulkan on supported GPUs

#### NVidia optimized variants

These variants contain all the backends from the generic variant, plus a CUDA backend that provides accelerated performance on supported NVidia GPUS. If the OpenCL backend is available on your platform, it also uses the CUDA OpenCL library instead of the generic one.

Make sure you have the latest NVidia GPU drivers installed and you will likely also need the [CUDA toolkit v12.8.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-8-0-download-archive) or newer.

If installing on Linux, to avoid installing the entire CUDA toolkit if you don't need it you can just install either the `cuda-runtime-12.8` package to get all the runtime libs and drivers, or the `cuda-libaries-12-8` package to just get the runtime libraries.

#### AMD optimized variants

These variants contain all the backends from the generic variant, plus a hipblas backend using AMD's ROCm framework that accelerates computation on [supported AMD GPUs](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-6.4.2/compatibility/compatibility-matrix.html)

Please ensure you have a compatible AMD GPU driver installed

I recommend [Nobara](https://nobaraproject.org), it has a great community and some custom ROCm libraries that are maintained by the community. You might need to make a symlink here or there but overall it's been easier to set up AI stuff on [Nobara](https://nobaraproject.org) (A flavour of Fedora) than any other distro I've played with. 

### Models
The plugin ships with the Tiny.en model, and will autonomously download other Whisper models through a dropdown.
There's also an option to select an external GGML Whisper model file if you have it on disk.

If using CoreML on Apple, it will also automatically download the appropriate CoreML encoder model for your selected model.

Get more models from https://ggml.ggerganov.com/ and [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/main), follow [the instructions on whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/master/models) to create your own models or download others such as distilled models.

## BOSSCAT Build Instructions

> **Important:** The BOSSCAT feature layers in this fork were written with the assistance of [Claude](https://claude.ai) (Anthropic AI). The code has been tested **only on Fedora/Nobara Linux with an AMD GPU (ROCm)**. All other platforms are untested. You build and run this entirely at your own risk — no warranty is provided.

---

### Linux (Fedora / Nobara — tested ✅)

#### 1. Clone the repo into a new folder

```sh
mkdir ~/bosscat-build && cd ~/bosscat-build
git clone https://github.com/unclescunter/BOSSCAT-localvocal.git
cd BOSSCAT-localvocal
```

#### 2. Check what you have

```sh
which ninja cmake gcc g++ ccache || echo "some tools missing"
pkg-config --exists Qt6Core && echo "Qt6 OK" || echo "MISSING: Qt6"
rpm -q obs-studio-devel || echo "MISSING: obs-studio-devel"
```

#### 3. Install dependencies

```sh
sudo dnf install -y cmake ninja-build ccache gcc gcc-c++ git \
  qt6-qtbase-devel qt6-qtbase-private-devel qt6-qtsvg-devel \
  libcurl-devel libicu-devel pkgconf-pkg-config mbedtls-devel \
  obs-studio-devel blas-devel lapack-devel openblas-devel \
  glslang ocl-icd-devel opencl-headers \
  rocm-runtime rocm-hip-devel rocm-opencl-devel rocwmma-devel \
  cargo rust
```

#### 4. Set your GPU acceleration

Set `ACCELERATION` to match your GPU - If this is wrong it will default to cpu and you won't be able to use your gpu for captioning:

| Value | Use when | Benefit |
|---|---|---|
| `amd` | AMD GPU with ROCm installed | hipBLAS/ROCm GPU acceleration — significantly faster inference |
| `nvidia` | NVIDIA GPU with CUDA installed | CUDA GPU acceleration |
| `generic` | No discrete GPU, unsupported GPU, or unsure | CPU + OpenBLAS + Vulkan/OpenCL — works everywhere |

```sh
export ACCELERATION=amd    # change to nvidia or generic as needed
```

#### 5. Build

Run the included script from the repo root:

```sh
./install.sh
```

Or for the people who like hard mode here's what the script does and you can do it too:

All four of these are **required** — the build will fail if any are missing:

```sh
export ACCELERATION=amd          # nvidia or generic — set above
export CFLAGS="-fPIC"
export CXXFLAGS="-fPIC"

cmake -B build_x86_64 --preset linux-x86_64 \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./release \
      -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON

cmake --build build_x86_64 --target install
```

> **Why `-fPIC` and `-DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON`?** Sub-dependencies (cpu_features, Whisper.cpp) build as static libraries linked into the final shared `.so`. Without position-independent code the linker fails at the last step with `relocation R_X86_64_32 ... recompile with -fPIC`. The env vars ensure the flag propagates into every sub-build that CMake spawns.  <- This specific issue was interesting to diagnose. Claude wanted to go into some deep system files and change cmake rather than just pass a variable. Careful out there.

#### 6. Install to OBS

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/obs-localvocal/bin/64bit
mkdir -p ~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/obs-localvocal/data

cp release/lib64/obs-plugins/obs-localvocal.so \
   ~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/obs-localvocal/bin/64bit/

cp -r release/lib64/obs-plugins/obs-localvocal \
   ~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/obs-localvocal/bin/64bit/

cp -r release/share/obs/obs-plugins/obs-localvocal/. \
   ~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/obs-localvocal/data/
```

The resulting layout should look like:
```
~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/obs-localvocal/
├── bin/64bit/
│   ├── obs-localvocal.so
│   └── obs-localvocal/
│       ├── libggml.so
│       ├── libggml-base.so
│       ├── libggml-blas.so
│       ├── libggml-hip.so
│       ├── libggml-vulkan.so
│       ├── libggml-opencl.so
│       ├── libggml-cpu-*.so  (one per CPU variant)
│       ├── libonnxruntime_providers_shared.so
│       ├── libonnxruntime.so -> libonnxruntime.so.1
│       ├── libonnxruntime.so.1 -> libonnxruntime.so.1.20.1
│       ├── libonnxruntime.so.1.20.1
│       ├── libwhisper.so -> libwhisper.so.1
│       ├── libwhisper.so.1 -> libwhisper.so.1.8.2
│       └── libwhisper.so.1.8.2
└── data/
    ├── locale/
    └── models/
```

Restart OBS. The **BOSSCAT Captions** dock will appear under Docks. It currently spawns on the right side of the window, you can move it but it does spawn there every time. I'll change that but for the moment that's how it works.

---

### Packaging a .deb for Ubuntu

> **IMPORTANT:** I probably don't need to do this because the build script should work fine but if it gets requested I'll throw up a .deb packge. 

### Troubleshooting (Linux)

**OBS says "plugin failed to load" with no detail**

Run OBS from a terminal to see the error (Run OBS [in x11] like this with a bash script so that hotkeys work):

```sh
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb obs
```

**`libamdhip64.so.6: cannot open shared object file`**

Your system has a different ROCm version (e.g. v7) but the plugin was linked against v6. One symlink to rule them all, change the number in ```libamdhip64.so.7``` in the following command for whichever version of `libamdhip64.so.*` you have :

```sh
sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libamdhip64.so.7 /usr/lib64/libamdhip64.so.6
sudo ldconfig
```


**`relocation R_X86_64_32 ... recompile with -fPIC`**

You missed one of the required flags. Wipe the build dir and start step 4 again with all three flags set.

---

### macOS and Windows (untested)

BOSSCAT has not been tested on macOS or Windows. The upstream obs-localvocal build instructions below should work for the base plugin, but the BOSSCAT-specific layers are untested on those platforms. For `ACCELERATION`, use `generic` on macOS (it uses Metal automatically) and `nvidia` or `generic` on Windows.

---

## Upstream Build Instructions - [Royshil's original build instructions](https://github.com/royshil/obs-localvocal)

The original obs-localvocal build documentation follows below for reference.

The plugin was built and tested on Nobara Linux and nothing else. Download the [base plugin from royshil](https://github.com/royshil/obs-localvocal) for a more stable experience. I will be co-opting the flatpak build instructions below to provide a flatpak package soon enough.

***ALL INSTRUCTIONS FOR MACOSX OR WINDOWS ARE UNSTESTED***

Start by cloning this repo to a directory of your choice.

### Mac OSX

Using the CI pipeline scripts, locally you would just call the zsh script, which builds for the architecture specified in $MACOS_ARCH (either `x86_64` or `arm64`).

```sh
$ MACOS_ARCH="x86_64" ./.github/scripts/build-macos -c Release
```

#### Install
The above script should succeed and the plugin files (e.g. `obs-localvocal.plugin`) will reside in the `./release/Release` folder off of the root. Copy the `.plugin` file to the OBS directory e.g. `~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/plugins`.

To get `.pkg` installer file, run for example
```sh
$ ./.github/scripts/package-macos -c Release
```
(Note that maybe the outputs will be in the `Release` folder and not the `install` folder like `pakage-macos` expects, so you will need to rename the folder from `build_x86_64/Release` to `build_x86_64/install`)

### Linux

#### Using pre-compiled variants

1. Clone the repository and if not using Ubuntu install the development versions of these dependencies using your distribution's package manager:

    * libcurl
    * libsimde
    * libssl
    * icu
    * openblas (preferably the OpenMP variant rather than the pthreads variant)
    * OpenCL
    * Vulkan

    Installing ccache is also recommended if you are likely to be building the plugin multiple times

1. Install rust via [rustup](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/) (recommended), or your distribution's package manager

1. Set the `ACCELERATION` environment variable to one of `generic`, `nvidia`, or `amd` (defaults to `generic` if unset)

    ```sh
    export ACCELERATION="nvidia"
    ```

1. Then from the repo directory build the plugin by running:

    ```sh
    ./.github/scripts/build-linux
    ```

    If you can't use the CI build script for some reason, you can build the plugin as follows

    ```sh
    cmake -B build_x86_64 --preset linux-x86_64 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./release
    cmake --build build_x86_64 --target install
    ```

1. Installing

    If using Ubuntu and the plugin was previously installed using a .deb package, copy the results to the standard OBS folders on Ubuntu

    ```sh
    sudo cp -R release/RelWithDebInfo/lib/* /usr/lib/
    sudo cp -R release/RelWithDebInfo/share/* /usr/share/
    ```

    Otherwise, follow the official [OBS plugins guide](https://obsproject.com/kb/plugins-guide) and copy the results to your user plugins folder
    ```sh
    mkdir -p ~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/obs-localvocal/bin/64bit
    cp -R release/RelWithDebInfo/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/obs-plugins/* ~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/obs-localvocal/bin/64bit/
    mkdir -p ~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/obs-localvocal/data
    cp -R release/RelWithDebInfo/share/obs/obs-plugins/obs-localvocal/* ~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/obs-localvocal/data/
    ```

    Note: The lib path in the release folder varies depending on your Linux distribution (e.g. on Gentoo the plugin libraries are found in `release/RelWithDebInfo/lib64/obs-plugins`) but the destination directory to copy them into will always be the same.

#### Building Whispercpp from source along with the plugin

If you can't use the CI build script for some reason, or simply prefer to build the Whispercpp dependency from source along with the plugin, follow the steps above but build the plugin using the following commands:

```sh
cmake -B build_x86_64 --preset linux-x86_64 -DLINUX_SOURCE_BUILD=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./release
cmake --build build_x86_64 --target install
```

When building from source, the Vulkan and OpenCL development libraries are optional and will only be used in the build if they are installed. Similarly if the CUDA or ROCm toolkits are found, they will also be used and the relevant Whisper backends will be enabled.

The default for a full source build is to build both Whisper and the plugin optimized for the host system. To change this behaviour add one or both of the following options to the CMake configure command (the first of the two):

* to build all CPU backends add `-DWHISPER_DYNAMIC_BACKENDS=ON`
* to build all CUDA kernels add `-DWHISPER_BUILD_ALL_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=ON`

### Linux (Flatpak)

Building the plugin as a Flatpak extension for OBS Studio allows for easy distribution and installation on Linux systems.

#### Prerequisites

1. Install Flatpak and flatpak-builder:
   ```sh
   # On Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install flatpak flatpak-builder
   
   # On Fedora
   sudo dnf install flatpak flatpak-builder
   
   # On Arch Linux
   sudo pacman -S flatpak flatpak-builder
   ```

2. Add the Flathub repository:
   ```sh
   flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
   ```

3. Install the OBS Studio Flatpak and required SDKs:
   ```sh
   flatpak install flathub com.obsproject.Studio
   flatpak install flathub org.kde.Sdk//6.8
   ```

#### Building

1. Clone the repository if you haven't already:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/locaal-ai/obs-localvocal.git
   cd obs-localvocal
   ```

2. Set the `ACCELERATION` environment variable to one of `generic`, `nvidia`, or `amd` (defaults to `generic` if unset):
   ```sh
   export ACCELERATION="nvidia"  # or "amd" or "generic"
   ```

3. Build the Flatpak extension:
   ```sh
   ./flatpak/build.sh --disable-rofiles-fuse --force-clean build-dir ./flatpak/com.obsproject.Studio.Plugin.LocalVocal.yaml
   ```

   The build process will:
   - Compile all dependencies including ICU 77, whisper.cpp, CTranslate2, etc.
   - Build the LocalVocal plugin with the selected acceleration backend
   - Create a Flatpak extension that integrates with OBS Studio

4. Installing the built extension:
   ```sh
   ./flatpak/build.sh --disable-rofiles-fuse --install build-dir ./flatpak/com.obsproject.Studio.Plugin.LocalVocal.yaml
   ```

   Or manually install using:
   ```sh
   flatpak-builder --user --install --force-clean build-dir ./flatpak/com.obsproject.Studio.Plugin.LocalVocal.yaml
   ```

5. Verify the installation:
   ```sh
   flatpak list | grep LocalVocal
   ```

#### Running OBS Studio with the Plugin

After installation, simply launch OBS Studio from your application menu or via:
```sh
flatpak run com.obsproject.Studio
```

The LocalVocal plugin should now be available in OBS Studio's filters.

#### Troubleshooting

- **Build fails with ICU errors**: The Flatpak build uses ICU 77 which is compiled as part of the build process. This is required for Qt's `uic` binary compatibility.
- **CUDA/ROCm not detected**: Make sure you've set the `ACCELERATION` environment variable before building.
- **Plugin not visible in OBS**: Ensure the Flatpak extension was installed to the correct location and OBS Studio is running from Flatpak.

### Windows

Use the CI scripts again, for example:

```powershell
> .github/scripts/Build-Windows.ps1 -Configuration Release
```

The build should exist in the `./release` folder off the root. You can manually install the files in the OBS directory.

```powershell
> Copy-Item -Recurse -Force "release\Release\*" -Destination "C:\Program Files\obs-studio\"
```

#### Building with CUDA support on Windows

LocalVocal will now build with CUDA support automatically through a prebuilt binary of Whisper.cpp from https://github.com/locaal-ai/locaal-ai-dep-whispercpp. The CMake scripts will download all necessary files.

To build with cuda add `ACCELERATION` as an environment variable (with `cpu`, `hipblas`, or `cuda`) and build regularly

```powershell
> $env:ACCELERATION="cuda"
> .github/scripts/Build-Windows.ps1 -Configuration Release
```

## General AI / ROCm Tips

A collection of environment variables and tweaks that are useful when running local AI workloads on AMD GPUs with ROCm, gathered from real-world testing.

**`HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0`** — Some AMD GPUs (e.g. RX 6700 XT / RDNA2) are not on ROCm's official support list but work correctly when you tell ROCm which GFX architecture to treat them as. Without this, ROCm silently ignores the GPU and falls back to CPU. Set it persistently in your environment (`~/.bashrc` or `/etc/environment`) so it applies to any ML workload, not just this plugin.
